# Robotic-Garbage_Collector
Introduction 

This Raspberry Pi robotic arm is mainly composed of an aluminum alloy bracket, a sturdy chassis, a multi-function expansion board, 6 bus servos and a 300,000 pixel camera. The requirements is Ubuntu20.04 noetic, Open Source CV and Python 3.8.10 programming to create a series of AI vision functions. 

About 
This Project is to develop a garbage collector and sorter robot. It implements Yolov5 deep learning model for garbage detection and classify the garbage whether is paper or plastic.

Manual robot setup is given which provide the details on how to run the code.
